        <p>Leaflet is a lightweight mapping library for Javascript. Well-documented,
        with an active developer community, and weighing in at only 38k, it is
      one of the leading mapping libraries used on the web today.</p>

      <p><strong>Leaflet Basics</strong></p>

      <p>Every Leaflet map has a few things in common:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A basemap;
        <li>A tile layer corresponding to that basemap;
        <li>An initial view, which sets the center point of the map and the zoom level.
      </ol>

      <p>All of these are called on the .map class, Leaflet's central class.</p>

      <p>But just showing a basemap and its corresponding tiles isn't all that interesting, and
      leaflet probably wouldn't exist if simple .png images of maps would do the job. Leaflet
      allows us to make data-driven maps with elements that we can style with CSS.</p>

      <p>Leaflet consumes GeoJSON, a flavor of JSON that lets us express latitude/longitude
      pairs and lots of other kinds of data about those points.</p>

      <p>In our example map below, we're using a basemap and tiles from the Metropolitan
      Area Planning Commission, an agency of the state of Massachusetts that does
      civic planning work. MAPC does a lot of transportation infrastructure work,
      including work that attempts to improve conditions for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

      <p>We can add a tile layer that shows bike trails and lanes from MAPC.</p>

      <p>That's interesting, but how does it relate to, say, bike accident data?</p>

      <p>I used the following  dataset on bike/car collisions.</p>

      <p>Since that dataset is in Excel, I needed to convert it into GeoJSON.
      But first, I noticed that what looked like lat/lon data was actually not.
      That meant we had to geocode the addresses. After concatenating fields
      with the address, city and state name, I handed the .csv data to a
      <a href = "https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchGeocoding.php">batch geocoder</a>,
      which translated the plain-english addresses into lat/lon pairs.</p>

      <p>That still needed to be converted into GeoJSON, which can be done at
      <a href ="http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm">ConvertCSV.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Leaflet depends on jQuery to load datasets, but now that we have
      our data in GeoJSON, we can call it.</p>
