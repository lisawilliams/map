# Making Maps With Leaflet.js

This is a copy of the code and slides for my talk on [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
to my cohort, WDI 18, at General Assembly Boston.

`index.html` will load a map with three layers:

* a base layer map of Boston, courtesy of the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission;
* a set of tiles, also from MAPC, showing bike lanes and bike trails;
* a layer showing [bicycle collision data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/24713), presented as GeoJSON.

A copy of my slides, in PDF format, is available within the repo.
