# Making Maps With Leaflet.js

This is a copy of the code and slides for my talk on [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
to my cohort, WDI 18, at General Assembly Boston.

`index.html` will load a map with three layers:

* a base layer map of Boston, courtesy of the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission;
* a set of tiles, also from MAPC, showing bike lanes and bike trails;
* a layer showing [bicycle collision data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/24713), presented as GeoJSON.

A [copy of my slides, in PDF format](https://github.com/lisawilliams/map/blob/master/web-maps.pdf), is available within the repo.

Examples of Leaflet-based maps shown in my talk:

* [Grand Canyon Geology](http://rclark.github.io/grand-canyon-geology/) Note the use of legends that respond to where a user mousovers;
* [LeafArctica](http://lo-ise.github.io/leafarctica/#0/-87/0) which maps satellite photography of Antarctica with a set of tiles with lat/lon coordinates. You can match photos to lat/lon to make 'photomaps.'
* [Windy](https://www.windy.com/?53.801,-1.582,4), a leaflet-based map that uses realtime data from weather stations
* [Zelda: Breath of the Wild] Maps don't have to be of Earth! Here's a map of Hyrule from the popular video game Zelda.
* [Every Shot Kobe Bryant Ever Took](http://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/) They don't even really have to be maps at all, as with this diagram of an NBA player's shots.
